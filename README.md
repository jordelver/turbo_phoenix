# Turbo Phoenix

A demo/learning application to explore the use of Turbolinks in conjunction with
Phoenix and Ecto. Turbolinks came from the Rails world, but I've never really
used it.

I'm also exploring how much CSS animation/transitions can be used in conjunction
with the speed of Phoenix in creating a smooth user experience.

Ultimately, this work will be compared to Phoenix LiveView in the future.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
